# Crop Disease Finder 
## About This Applications
### The CROP PROTECTION AND ADVISORY SYSTEM (CPAS) is a revolutionary mobile app that is aimed at improving the agriculture sector. It uses cutting-edge technology such as image recognition and deep neural networks to detect the type of pest that is causing the infection in crops when an image of the infected plant is uploaded along with necessary details. The deep neural network model is trained on a large dataset of images and can be updated regularly with new images provided by users. This system contains comprehensive information on various plant and crop diseases and the corresponding treatments for different stages of the disease. The app generates necessary advisory for farmers to combat the pest and protect their crops.

The app has a user-friendly interface that allows different stakeholders in agriculture to access or update information based on their privileges. It is designed as a social community where farmers can post problems and receive solutions from agriculture experts or fellow farmers. The app is multi-lingual, making it accessible to farmers from different parts of the country, regardless of language barriers. The app also has a personal voice assistant to help illiterate farmers access information and services. Additionally, the proposed deep learning model is made available as a cloud service for users with limited device resources
